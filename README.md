Node Module Group challenge!

Create a couple modules to complete this challenge.

The first module will export a function that returns a random number after taking in a min and max value as arguments. When you call this module, use '100' as your min, and '1000000' as your max.

The second module should accept a number and convert it to a USD value.

The third module should require the other two modules. It should have two function exports. The first function export should be the return of the first module being passed into the second module. The other function should be a simple text return that says “Account balance: \n”.

Finally, in the app.js, bring it all together! At the end you should be able to run "node app.js" and it will produce the result.
